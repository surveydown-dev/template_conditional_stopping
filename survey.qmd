# Template - Conditional Stopping

::: {.callout-tip}
1. The `zip` and `yob` questions are not defined as required in YAML, but they are auto-marked as required because the `sd_stop_if()` function call in **app.R** mentions them as judgements.
2. The `pet_preference` question is explicitly defined as required in YAML.
3. The `sd_stop_if()` logic has higher priority than the required question logic. As you click on the "Next" button, the system checks the `sd_stop_if()` conditions first, then checks if the required questions are answered.

Hi! This is a showcase of the "conditional stopping" feature that surveydown supports.

The ZIP code question only allows **5 digits**.

```{r}
sd_question(
  type  = "numeric",
  id    = "zip",
  label = "What's your zip code?"
)
```

The year of birth question only allows values **greater than 1900**.

```{r}
sd_question(
  type  = "numeric",
  id    = "yob",
  label = "What's your year of birth?"
)
```

A dummy **required** question to showcase the priority of the system prompt.

```{r}
sd_question(
  type  = 'mc',
  id    = 'pet_preference',
  label = "Which pet do you prefer, cat or dog?",
  option = c(
    'Cat' = 'cat',
    'Dog' = 'dog'
  )
)
```

The phone number question only allows **10 digits**.

```{r}
sd_question(
  type  = "text",
  id    = "phone",
  label = "What's your phone number?"
)
```

--- end

## This is the end of the survey template of the conditional stopping feature.

```{r}
sd_close()
```
